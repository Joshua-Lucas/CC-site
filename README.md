# My Portfolio

This is a recreation of my portfolio using Next.js, Typescript and Styled-Components.

Here is my current portfolio which will remain up (https://joshualucasportfolio.herokuapp.com/)

The purpose of recreating my portfolio was to get practice the whole process of developing a website.

## My Process

#### Design:
---

- Used dribble and different websites from Next.js projects for inspiration.

- Determined color pallete and typography.

- Design each section of the page with Gimp

#### Development:
---

- I pulled in a [Next Boilerplate](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest) that had prettier,eslint,jest, and typescript configured and then i added styled-componets.
  

- I will then develop and style based on the design i created

- I plan to use a Firebase for my backend

#### Deploy:
---

- The plan is to host on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and add my domain name.
